**Note**: Each of these documents should be created as separate, detailed specifications. They should maintain consistent formatting and cross-referencing with the main technical architecture document while focusing on their specific domains. This ensures comprehensive coverage of all aspects of game development without duplicating information.

The relationship between these documents and the main technical architecture should be clearly defined through a master index, ensuring that teams can easily navigate between related sections across different documents.
