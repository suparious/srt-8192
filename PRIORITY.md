# Development Priorities

## Critical Misalignments

### 1. Infrastructure Setup (In Progress)
- Current: Basic Docker setup started with base templates
- Missing:
  - Environment variable management
  - Service health checks
  - Development vs production configurations
  - Proper entrypoint scripts
  - Container security hardening
  - Volume management for data persistence

### 2. AI System (NexusMind)
- Current: Basic behavior in OpponentAI.ts
- Missing:
  - TensorFlow integration
  - Reinforcement learning implementation
  - Pattern recognition system
  - Real-time adaptation logic

### 3. Data Integration (DataForge)
- Current: Placeholder implementations
- Missing:
  - Economic data processors
  - Geopolitical data integration
  - Weather system integration
  - Real-time data feeds

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Current: Basic testing setup
- Missing:
  - Unit test suites
  - Integration tests
  - AI behavior testing
  - Load/stress testing
  - Container testing framework
  - CI/CD pipeline integration

### 5. Frontend Components
- Current: Basic UI implementation
- Missing:
  - Advanced resource visualization
  - Combat system UI
  - Real-time updates
  - Tutorial system

## Implementation Priority Order
1. Infrastructure Setup
   - Complete Docker environment
   - Implement environment management
   - Setup health monitoring
   - Configure data persistence
2. Testing Infrastructure
   - Setup testing framework
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
3. AI System Core
4. Data Integration
5. Frontend Components

## Next Steps
1. Create development and production Docker configurations
2. Implement environment variable management
3. Setup service health checks and monitoring
4. Configure volume management for data persistence
5. Implement proper service entrypoints
6. Setup container security measures
